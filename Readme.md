### Demo in blender

* [Game engine](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/game_engine/index.html)
* Physics and gravity
	* Simple box that fall (gravety01)
	* Simple box that hit something (gravity02)
	* Parented boxes (gravety03)
	
* Joined boxes
	* Bounding boxes (gravity04)
	* Center of mass (**Shift-Control-Alt-C**)
